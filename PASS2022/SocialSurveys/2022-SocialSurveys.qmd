    * Are there any sociological questions that cannot be answered through social surveys?
    * What are the advantages and limitations of survey methodology?
    * Read about the Understanding Society survey <a href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/about/about-the-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>  and listen to the podcast below in which researchers involved in designing the survey discuss its characteristics and their challenges:
