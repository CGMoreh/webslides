## To Do List {.scrollable .smaller}

1. Read Rachel Ayrton's (2017) ['Time for a revival? A historical review of the social survey in Great Britain and the United States'](https://ncl.instructure.com/courses/43837/files/5761553/download) (National Centre for Research Methods, pp. 1-25)
2. Attend the lecture on "Social Surveys"
3. Prepare for the seminar discussions by doing the following:
    * Come up with a sociologically relevant question that you believe can be answered through a social survey. How would you design your study, step by step?
    * Are there any sociological questions that cannot be answered through social surveys?
    * What are the advantages and limitations of survey methodology?
    * Read about the Understanding Society survey <a href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/about/about-the-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>  and listen to the podcast below in which researchers involved in designing the survey discuss its characteristics and their challenges:

* What new terms and concepts have you learnt about from these sources?

<br>

 - Anders Nicolai Kiaer (1838-1919):     
    - collected a wide range of individual-level data (on over 80,000 individuals) on a national basis that were needed in preparation for a new social insurance act
    - a shift from typological to population thinking
    - representativeness as a sample that was a 'true miniature' of a population
    - **purposive** or 'judgmental' sampling
 - Arthur Lyon Bowley (1869-1957) and Jerzy Neyman (1894-1981):
    - **stratified sampling**: using existing knowledge of the population to divide it into relatively homogeneous groups in some respects, then randomly sampling within groups
    - **random sampling** as the best method to minimise sampling error
