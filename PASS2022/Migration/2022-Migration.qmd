## Migration in sociology {background-image="././pics/VIZ5.jpg" background-opacity=0.2}

- Migration has been central to the social sciences 
    - Theories of belonging (assimilation, multiculturalism) - *Sociology* 
    - Citizenship and Immigration Policy - *Politics*
    - Immigration enforcement and border security - *Criminology*	
- Traditionally, social sciences have studied fixity rather than mobility 


## Definitions {background-image="././pics/VIZ5.jpg" background-opacity=0.2}

International Organization for Migration definitions:

- Migration: The movement of a person or a group of persons, either across an international border, or within a State. 
     - any kind of movement of people, whatever its length, composition and causes
     - includes migration of refugees, displaced persons, economic migrants, and persons moving for other purposes, including family reunification.
     - **E**migration: leaving one nation-state for another 
     - **Im**migration: moving into a new nation-state 
- Migrant: an individual who has resided in a foreign country for more than one year irrespective of the causes (voluntary or involuntary) and the means (regular or irregular) used to migrate

## Definitions {background-image="././pics/VIZ5.jpg" background-opacity=0.2}

International Organization for Migration definitions:

- Diaspora: the dispersal of people outside their "homeland" (literally: scatter across)
- Transnationalism: ongoing contact and connections between sending and receiving societies
- Assimilation: adaptation of one ethnic or social group - usually a minority - to another. Assimilation involves the subsuming of language, traditions, values, mores and behaviour or even fundamental vital interests.

## Types of migration {background-image="././pics/VIZ5.jpg" background-opacity=0.2}

- Intra-national vs. international?
- Temporary vs. permanent?
- Legal vs. illegal/Orderly vs. Irregular?
     - "irregular" is preferable to "illegal" because the latter carries a criminal connotation. Sociologists usually restrict the use of the term "illegal migration" to cases of smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons.
- Voluntary vs. forced?
- Skilled vs. unskilled?

## Causes of migration {background-image="././pics/VIZ5.jpg" background-opacity=0.2}

- Economic factors
    - Higher wages; (better) job opportunities; etc.
- Social factors
    - Other migrants; social oppression; better life; etc.
- Political factors
    - War; persecution; absence of human rights; etc.
- Environmental factors
    - Natural disasters; scarce resources; etc.
    
## Impact of Migration  {background-image="././pics/VIZ5.jpg" background-opacity=0.2}

- Impact on 'receiving' or 'host' society?
- Impact on 'sending' or 'home' society?
- Impact between states (multi-national issues)?
- Impact on the migrant?
- Impact on migrants?

## Global tendencies {background-image="././pics/VIZ5.jpg" background-opacity=0.2}

1. The **globalization** of migration
2. The **differentiation** of migration
3. The **changing direction** of dominant migration flows
4. The proliferation of **migration transition**
5. The **feminization** of labour migration
6. The increasing **politicization** of migration
7. The **climatization** of migration

## Globalization {background-image="././pics/VIZ5.jpg" background-opacity=0.2}
- more and more countries significantly affected by international migration
- an increasingly diverse array of source countries
- entrants from a broad spectrum of economic, social and cultural backgrounds

## Differentiation {background-image="././pics/VIZ5.jpg" background-opacity=0.2}

- Not one type of migration, such as labour migration, family reunion, refugee movement or permanent settlement, but a whole range of types at once. 
- Migratory chains which start with one type of movement often continue with other forms, despite (or often just because of) government efforts to stop or control the movement


## Channging migration flows {background-image="././pics/VIZ5.jpg" background-opacity=0.2}

- Following WW2 the pattern changed, and Europe shifted from being a sending region to becoming a receiving region
- Other regions and countries of emigration emerged
- Strengthening South-North migration 


## Proliferation of migration transition {background-image="././pics/VIZ5.jpg" background-opacity=0.2}

- when traditional lands of emigration become lands of immigration
- Often preceded by transit migration 
- States as diverse as Poland, Spain, Morocco, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Turkey and South Korea are experiencing various stages and forms of a migration transition. 
- But other countries, for example in Latin America, have experienced reverse migration transitions as they changed from immigration to emigration countries.


## Feminization {background-image="././pics/VIZ5.jpg" background-opacity=0.2}

- Traditionally many labour migration seen as male dominated 
- Since the 1960s, women have not only played an increasing role in labour migration, but also the awareness of women's role in migration has grown. 
- Today women workers form the majority in movements as diverse as those of Cape Verdeans to Italy, Filipinas to the Middle East and Thais to Japan. 


## Politicization {background-image="././pics/VIZ5.jpg" background-opacity=0.2}

- Frameworks of Managing and Regulating Migration- International Agreements:
    - 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
    - 1967 UN Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees 
- U.K. Policies: 
    - British Nationality Act, 1948, 1981 
    - Commonwealth Immigrants Act, 1962, 1968 
- Brexit


## Conclusions and activities {background-image="././pics/VIZ5.jpg" background-opacity=0.2}

- Migration is a very broad topic
- A very interdisciplinary topic
- And one that requires a variety of methods to study

- **Activities:**

    - Watch the ten short ['Migration 101'](http://migrationmatters.me/course/migration-101/) series episodes on the Migration Matters webpage
    - Watch the episodes in the [Six Impossible Ideas (After Brexit)](http://migrationmatters.me/course/six-ideas/) series on the Migration Matters webpage
