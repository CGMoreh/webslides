> "Even if it were possible to observe people closely as their lives proceeded, we could not guarantee that this strategy would collect"truer" information, especially about such unobservable matters as motivations, perceptions, and views " [@gerson2020, pp.20?]

-   also the question of 'stories'; for this, see also @byrne2002

-   stories about cases, individual or 'variables' :::

## Topic

-   a picture that needs attribution here...

[Curtesy of someone who made this]{.attribution}

-   'explanatory' rather than 'predictive analysis' (Gerson and damaske 2020; 14)[@gerson2020]

-   "what," "why," and "how" questions. - 'depth interviewing' that connect inductive approaches to theory

-   what can small samples tell us?

## Sanpling 1

-   setting 'sample bundaries' depth interviewing)

[^2]: Lyric from the 2008 song *Human* by *The Killers*. There was some confusion about the lyrics among fans and the band's frontman clarified that he sings 'dancer', not 'denser'. "I guess it bothers people that it's not grammatically correct, but I think I'm allowed to do whatever I want", he said. Apparently, the lyric alludes to a quote from journalist Hunter S. Thompson about how "America is raising a generation of dancers, afraid to take one step out of line" [(https://www.digitalspy.com/music/a134344/flowers-clears-up-human-confusion/)](https://www.digitalspy.com/music/a134344/flowers-clears-up-human-confusion/)
