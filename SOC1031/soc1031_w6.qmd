-   "I guess it bothers people that it's not grammatically correct, but I think I'm allowed to do whatever I want" (Killers' frontman)
-   Apparently, alludes to a quote from journalist Hunter S. Thompson about how "America is raising a generation of dancers, afraid to take one step out of line" [(link)](https://www.digitalspy.com/music/a134344/flowers-clears-up-human-confusion/)

## Sociology as art

. . .

What kind of art?

. . .

Literature? Performative? Martial?

. . .

> It is my deeply held conviction that the very best social science research of the coming era will be exactly this kind of research—research that draws on the kinds of **bold** and **interdisciplinary** insights you can get when you salsa-dance. But be warned: you can’t just show up at a salsa dancing palace and expect to have as much fun as you should without having done at least a little training ahead of time. For all its improvisational nature, salsa dancing builds on **some very specific steps** [@Luker2008SalsaDancingSocialSciencesResearch, p. 2]


## Sociology as science

::: {.big-ul}
- A population science? [@Goldthorpe2016SociologyPopulationScience]
:::

. . .

> Sociology has to be understood as a population science, primarily on account of the degree of variability evident in human social life, at the level of sociocultural entities, but also, and crucially, at the individual level – this latter variability being inadequately treated within the ‘holistic’ paradigm of inquiry, for long prevalent in sociology but now increasingly called into question [@Goldthorpe2016SociologyPopulationScience, p. 17]
