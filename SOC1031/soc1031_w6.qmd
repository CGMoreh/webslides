## Sociology as art

. . .

What kind of art?

. . .

Literature? Performative? Martial?

## Sociology as art

> It is my deeply held conviction that the very best social science research of the coming era will be exactly this kind of research—research that draws on the kinds of **bold** and **interdisciplinary** insights you can get when you salsa-dance. But be warned: you can’t just show up at a salsa dancing palace and expect to have as much fun as you should without having done at least a little training ahead of time. For all its improvisational nature, salsa dancing builds on **some very specific steps** [@Luker2008SalsaDancingSocialSciencesResearch, p. 2]


## Sociology as science

::: {.big-ul}
- A population science? [@Goldthorpe2016SociologyPopulationScience]
:::

. . .

> Sociology has to be understood as a population science, primarily on account of the degree of **variability** evident in human social life, at the level of sociocultural entities, but also, and crucially, at the individual level – this latter variability being inadequately treated within the ‘holistic’ paradigm of inquiry, for long prevalent in sociology but now increasingly called into question [@Goldthorpe2016SociologyPopulationScience, p. 17]

::: {.big-ul}
- An information science?
:::

## Theory as method

::: {big-ul}
- A language, indispensable to science
- The theoretical language always includes an interpretation of the social reality. We see and understand the world with the help of theories. Theories here serve as an interpretative framework
- Theories are indispensable when it comes to explanation, since they conceptualize causal mechanisms
- Theories are abstractions; they describe phenomena with reference to certain aspects, which have been separated from other aspects also characterizing concrete events or phenomena
- Theories can be of different kinds:  metatheories, normative theories, general and more specific descriptive theories
:::

## Theorizing

::: {big-ul}
- Builds on the work of philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914)
- The crucial role of “guessing” in scientific research. It is precisely through guessing that the most important part of the scientific analysis is produced—namely, the explanation.
- The term that Charles S. Peirce most often used to refer to the guess of a hypothesis is abduction
- Creative theorizing is an abductive-oriented type of theorizing
- It’s more like developing the kind of intuitive thinking that ‘experts’ possess. 
- Developing it is a question of practice (reading and thinking)
:::

## Theorizing

::: {big-ul}
- A 3-step process: abduction, deduction and induction
- Intensive observation until one is surprised (the surprise comes from finding something that should not be there according to the current state of scientific knowledge)
- Come up with an idea for what explains the facts that caused the surprise: abduction (requires to somehow access the less conscious parts of one’s mind)
- It must be possible to test this idea empirically; and the test must be successful. 
- The testing part is called induction by Peirce. This stage is preceded by deduction, during which the researcher tries to deduct hypotheses to test from the original idea or abduction
